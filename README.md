# neternity

Neural network for text recognition. Writen in Python with numpy.

## Usage

- install dependencies from requirements.txt
- run initialize.py
    to create layers for NN
- run pic.py
    to create training images
- run learn.py
    to start teaching NN
- run start.py
    to recognize text on other image

## Limitation

This is very simple NN and will not work with complex image.
Goal is to recognize scanned-like text in high resolution.
